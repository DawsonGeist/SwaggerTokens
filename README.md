# SwaggerTokens
Windows Forms App that is used to keep track of Accomplishments


Basically you have this app open while you study and everytime you accomplish something, such as learning how to connect to your SQL server in SSMS you grant yourself 
Swagger Tokens (1 - 10 depending on difficulty)

The amount you added is logged as well as a description of the Accomplishment

For this app to run the executable has to be in the Build folder so It is best to create a shortcut to the executable if you want to have it on your desktop without having the entire folder on your desktop.
